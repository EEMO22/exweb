# Master Guideline: Designer Portfolio Website Project

Hello. You are my assistant for building a designer portfolio website. This document contains the complete project specification. You must adhere to these guidelines strictly. I am a beginner with this tech stack, so please guide me in a step-by-step manner.

---

### **1. üéØ Project Goal**

To create a clean, professional, and functional online platform where designers can effectively showcase their work and communicate with potential clients, employers, and a community.

### **2. üíª Tech Stack & Environment**

- **Operating System**: **Windows 10**
- **Frontend**: **React**
- **State Management**: **Zustand** (Simple, Pinia-like API is preferred)
- **Styling**: **Tailwind CSS v4** (Utility-first approach)
- **Package Manager (Node.js)**: **pnpm**
- **Backend**: **Django** + **Django REST Framework (DRF)**
- **Database**: **PostgreSQL**
- **Package Manager (Python)**: **uv**

### **3. üèõÔ∏è Core Architectural Principles**

- **Strict Separation of Concerns**: Frontend handles UI/UX only. Backend handles API and business logic only.
- **Stateless API**: Use **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** for authentication. No server-side sessions.
- **Security First**: Validate all inputs on the backend (via DRF Serializers). Use the ORM correctly to prevent SQL injection.

### **4. üßë‚Äçüé® User Roles & Permissions**

- **Designer (Owner)**:
  - Can sign up and log in.
  - Can create, read, update, and delete their **own** portfolios.
  - Can create, read, update, and delete their **own** posts and comments on the board.
  - Can manage their own user profile information.
- **Visitor (Guest)**:
  - Can browse all public portfolios and board posts without an account.
  - Can view designer profiles and their work.
  - Can see a designer's contact information (e.g., email), if provided.

    - Shows project title, detailed description, and tech stack used.
    - Displays all associated media (images, videos).
    - Links to the profile of the designer who created it.

    - Includes pagination to handle many posts.
    - A search bar to find posts by title or content.
  - **Detail View (`/board/<id>`)**:
    - Shows the full content of the post.
    - Lists all comments for the post.
    - Provides a form to submit a new comment.

### **8. ü§ñ Your Role as AI & My Requests for You**

1.  **Be Beginner-Friendly**: I am new to this stack. Explain the **"why"** behind the code, not just the "how".
2.  **Use a Step-by-Step Approach**: Break down large tasks into smaller, manageable steps. Guide me through them one by one.
3.  **Maintain Consistency**: All generated code **must** strictly follow the specifications in this document.
4.  **Ask Clarifying Questions**: If my request is ambiguous, ask for more details instead of making assumptions.
